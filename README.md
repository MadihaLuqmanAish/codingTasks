Random forest application on Titanic Data set
This analysis provides a comprehensive comparison of various tree-based models for predicting survival on the Titanic. By tuning the model parameters, we identified the best-performing model and highlighted the most significant features influencing survival.
Results
Most Important Feature:

From the random forest model, the most significant feature contributing to the prediction of survival was identified.
Model Performance:

The accuracy of all models was reported.
The best-performing model was identified along with the optimal values for n_estimators and max_dept
